Preventing the isolation of personnel in a Chief of Mission environment demands constant attention from both individuals and their organizations’ leaders.  To reduce the risk to personal safety and security, PR preparation, education, and training programs need to be in place to reduce the risk of isolation.  Preventive actions in PR are those measures taken to reduce individual susceptibility to isolation and mitigate the adversary’s opportunities to capture isolated personnel.</p><p><b>Prepare:</b> The prepare function focuses on preparing at risk US government personnel, agencies, and departments for an isolating event. US government officials should establish dialogues with foreign counterparts about PR training and local capabilities.  The Combatant Command PR Office of Primary Responsibility, or OPR, together with the Senior Defense Official or Defense Attaché assess DOD capabilities across the area of responsibility to determine PR capabilities and adjust planning efforts as appropriate.  Preparation prescribes PR actions to ensure the response, either as an individual or as a recovery force to the incident, will be effective and the outcome successful.
